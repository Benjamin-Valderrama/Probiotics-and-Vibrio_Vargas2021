## Probiotics and its effects on the immune response of *D. rerio* infected with *V. anguillarum*

In this repository you can find a re-analysis of part of the data from the Vargas 2021 paper ["Probiotic Yeasts and Vibrio anguillarum Infection Modify the Microbiome of Zebrafish Larvae"](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.647977/full). Raw data is stored in the [ENA Project: PRJEB38908](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB38908?show=reads)

## In this repository you can find:

**Code :** Code[<sup>1</sup>](##-Foot-Notes) used to produce figures[<sup>2</sup>](##-Foot-Notes) similar to the ones you can find in the paper.

**Data :** The same phyloseq object I used to conduct the code of this repository.

## Foot Notes:

1. The code is commented in Spanish 

2. The code doesn't export the Images produced by running it in R. If you want to export them you have to do so manually.
